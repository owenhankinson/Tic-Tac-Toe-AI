# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

In this project from school, I used knowledge I gained from my Artificial Intelligence class, in order to design my own verion of the Min-Max algorithm, which gives the tic tac toe AI the infallibility it shows.

In order to run this program you must have at least python 3.7 and you must download the packages included in the repository.
